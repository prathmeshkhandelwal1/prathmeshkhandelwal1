## Hi there, I'm [Prathmesh!](https://prathmesh.netlify.app/) ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a sophomore at IIITV persuing Information Technology.
- ðŸŒ± Nowdays I'm learning Javascript and DSA.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Nodejs and react based projects
- ðŸ’¬ I write Javascript for dev and C++ for competitive programming, So ask me about that.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Other than programming, I love watching anime.
